    description:
      Use additional variables, prefixed with x- to store common values or
      objects that are re-used for multiple users. You can use this for example
      to specify lists of config paths that should be accessible to specific
      services, or to define the IPs of machines, used by multiple users, in
      one place. Use YAML anchors to reference these parts from the
      users list.
